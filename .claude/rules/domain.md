# Domain Code Rules

These rules apply when working on domain/business logic.

## DDD Principles
- Keep domain logic in domain layer
- Use ubiquitous language
- Aggregates enforce invariants
- Domain events for side effects

## Patterns
- Entities have identity
- Value objects are immutable
- Services for cross-aggregate operations

# API Code Rules

These rules apply when working on API-related code.

## Patterns
- Use RESTful conventions
- Validate all input at boundaries
- Return consistent error formats
- Include request ID in responses

## Security
- Never trust client input
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting
- Log security-relevant events
